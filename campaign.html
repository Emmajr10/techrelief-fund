            Meet Amin, a high school junior who dreams of becoming a software engineer. 
            Before receiving a refurbished laptop, she completed assignments using her 
            phone and borrowed devices from classmates. With reliable access to her own 
            computer, Amina can now attend virtual tutoring sessions, complete coding 
            projects, and apply for college scholarships confidently.
        </p>

            This campaign collects donated laptops, professionally refurbishes them, 
            installs updated software, and distributes them to underserved students 
            who lack access to personal technology.
        </p>
