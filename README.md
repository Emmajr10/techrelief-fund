This project involved designing and developing a fundraising website prototype focused on supporting IT services for underserved communities. 
The purpose was to create both a paper prototype and a working HTML/CSS prototype demonstrating layout, navigation, and structure without backend functionality.
This project demonstrated the importance of planning through paper prototyping before development. 
The paper prototype made it easier to visualize layout and navigation flow before writing HTML code.
Converting the design into a working prototype reinforced the relationship between conceptual design and front-end implementation. 
The project also highlighted how full functionality requires backend systems and secure payment integration.
